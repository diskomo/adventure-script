 ### Hosting a tour

Using a gamepad:
 - Spawn the tour bus (`R3 + DPAD DOWN`)
 - Fly/teleport your bus around the map to pick up passengers
 - While driving the tour bus, you can quickly cycle through stops (`R3 + DPAD UP`)
 - To browse all the stops (including alternate locations/vehicles), use the Adventure Tours menu within `Stand>Lua Scripts`
 - Once you arrive at a destination, turn on spawn mode (`R3 + DPAD RIGHT`), which will enable spawn mode. This shows a yellow/black marker on the ground that you can control with the camera. Hold `RT` and move the marker and draw out a grid of vehicles to spawn depending on your passenger count! You can toggle spawn mode on/off with `R3 + DPAD RIGHT`
 - To remove all spawned vehicles, press (`R3 + DPAD LEFT`)
